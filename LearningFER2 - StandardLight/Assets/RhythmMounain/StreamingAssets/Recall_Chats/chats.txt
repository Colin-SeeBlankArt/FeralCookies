is playing based on audio length

AudioSource myAudio;
void Start()
{
	myAudio=GetComponent<AudioSource>();
}
void Update()
{
	if(!myAudio.isPlaying)
	{
		//do something
	}

for timer in my  script:

private float elapsed;
private float timerSpeed = 0.2f;

   if (  )  //some kind of trigger
	{
		elapsed += Time.deltaTime;
		if (elapsed >= timerSpeed)
		{
			elapsed = 0f;
			Destroy(gameObject);
		}
	}

click button -> GmObj.soundBox - active
this plays song until length of loop is met
	use GreenCoin to keep BassLoop running

what I want:

Scoring system needs => 2 systems for material changes
1	only green coins

2	red at 25%

3	no blue coin
		unlock blue with a loop count
			rename blue loop as _songLoop
			
4	no purp coin
		unlock purp with loop count
			rename purple loop as _bonusLoop (?)



Coin Count is no longer tied to game winning, Song Length is after Loop Count.

Purple = Speed Bonus!!(collected, min 0, Max 5)

Concept 1 - 
Speed Runner, 6 lanes, simple obstacles, lots of bunnies,
music plays as long as the player is moving. 
	bumpers need to reduce speed
speed variables are set to green ++, red ++,

Purple is shield - spawn a new object which destroys bunnies.
Blue is extra points towards score and loop unlocks
	(either 8 green, or any combo of blue coin pick up + gC PU)

bass a = 4 greebn coins
keysA1 (1) = 2 blue min
keysA1 (2) = 4 blue min && (keysA1 (2)Bool)

in LoopMachine: change to _arrayA through _arrayD, swap out for loop names, keep things generic
in ScoringSystem: swap loop names for generic array names (above)
audio box (!isPlaying) - LoopMachine._playNextTrack=true;
LoopMachine if(_playNextTrack) - _nextTrack++;


LEVEL ONE
Speed: 5=13

level 1.0:
	limited bunny - test between 20 and 15 for counts (GM)
	slow: 
		test high orientations
		

level 1.1:
	limited Rover - test between 20 and 15 for counts (GM)
	
If Speed is slow (8-10)	
	Turns
		sharp, abundant
	Hills
		small, abundant
	Rolls
		??
skybox ideas:
lvl 1 - dark
	black/purple, limited light on materials
		Level1-1D: 
			
lvl 2 - night/evening
	stars, blue-purple, 
lvl 3 - dusk/morning
	pinks/oranges on horizons, deep blue - medium navy


Make Good bunnies ---
change speed
change color to green and blue
add speed boost for a time 2 seconds, 
		invinciblity
		need Audio
		tie to Game Manager, PlayerCtl,
