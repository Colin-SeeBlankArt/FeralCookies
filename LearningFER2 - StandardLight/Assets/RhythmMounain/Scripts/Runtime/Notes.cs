 ================Using this as a Note Pad of ideas for Scriptig=================================

    Brick - Player collides with Brick Tag, Bricks with Tag are destroyed. 
    Focus Brick - this Brick will define which type of Brick is active for positive gains in the players movement stats, Brick stats, and Impending Doom's stats.
    Loop - earn the proper numbers of Focus Bricks, complete the loop to a specified level:

        0-25% - not much changes, Loop is a "Start Mode" meaning the player must collect more Focus Notes.
                Bricks are diificult to dicern which type they are, the Focus Brick looks like the Non-Focus Bricks
                The Focus Bricks become easier to define as more notes are there. Easy Measures can have simple note structures
                Add dificulty by adding different layers to the loops brick (note variation, tempo variation, pitch variation)
                        
        25-50% - Secondary Loop Bricks begin to show, allowing the player to see which Brick is correct.
